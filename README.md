# Zero-to-hero-course
Work through of Karpathy's "zero to hero" course on Youtube

(first project on GitHub... working to transition into the ML/AI space and wanted to start simply with this video series)

**Part 1:** building micrograd.
-_ Key takeaway_: I love calculus! Another relevant point for students... why do we care about derivatives and local minima?? Machine learning! A better answer, perhaps, than 'to find the maximum area of a garden using a fixed amount of material...'
